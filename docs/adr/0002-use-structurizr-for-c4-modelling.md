# 2. Use structurizr for C4 Modelling

Date: 2025-02-05

## Status

TBD

## Context

To communicate goals and state of this project we need documentation in different levels of detail and complexity.
Diagrams are essential in communicating the project design.
Documentation is bound to change a lot. 

## Decision

We prop√ºose to use the structurizr paradigma of "diagrams as code" see https://structurizr.com
Structurizr supports adr-tools.
Other solutions like mermaid lack the complexity neede for a C$ Modelling.

## Consequences

Since the files of the documentation are part of the codebase in the git repository versioning and collaboration will be greatly facilliated.
Developers will need to learn structurizr DSL.
